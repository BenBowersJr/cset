The most difficult aspect in developing with a larger team would be using the git branch commands. working with branches and pushing changes is going to take some getting used to. Im happy we are getting into collaboration  this early so we can use it throughout the year to get more comfortable with it.

A remote is a copy of some code/repo that is stored in a seperate location. We access our remote repositories of our own projects stored on github with urls like ```git@github.com:BenBowersJr/dom-adventure-game.git```. and a branch is a seperate copy of the code/repo at a certain point of time. We can then change then code in the branch without changing the original copy of the code. Later we can merge that branches code back into the original code.

For our own projects this week we used a centralized workflow, as well as a feature branch workflow. First we all created our own forks of Zacks code. that created  our own central repositories of the code we made hcanges to and made the project on. Then the made our own "feature branches" of our groups code that we got off of github. We made changes to that branches code, and because we dont have access to change the original of our groups code. we issued a pull request, to ask the group memeber if they wanted to merge our changes into there master copy of the code.
