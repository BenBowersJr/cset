Question 1: After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?
My biggest challenge in this program would probually be projects we have to do. Im expecting them to take allot of problem solving and time. while its going to be challanging, Im excited and up for the challenge! I put allot of time into learning the concepts and what we learn from class into practice and testing things on my own time.  

Question 2: Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.
For loops run for a set about of times determined in the code. While loops run infinitely as long as the conditional statement is true, if its false, the code in that loop does not run. Do While loops run at least once (the do) and THEN run infinitely if the conditional statement is true (the while) 

Question 3: We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?
Pseudocode is used to help the programmer plan and understand the program he is writing. From that plan he can write the program and find issues in the logic of the code. Often the pseudocode turns into the comments in the code, explaining what the program does so its easier to read. It also helps with "thinking like a programmer"
