Question 1:
For this week I wouldn't say I learned much new material, it was mainly a much needed refresher and review on what I learned in highschool. What was new to me and interesting to learn was the automatic type conversion and how javascript handles using two different data types together and trys to force them to work.

Question 2:
The idea of having multiple levels of programming is to make programming easier to write or understand by making it as close as possible to normal english. The lower level of programming means the closer you are to the binary ones and zeros. while the higher the level of programming the closer you are to Javascript or C. Some quick examples of low level programming is assembly and machine code.

Question 3:
I think that Javascript being flexible with its value types working together helps me, just as much as it could be a detriment to me. With it being flexible, any possible errors I happen to make can be fixed without me knowing that there was a issue in the first place. But it can also hurt me in the same way, and cause some logical errors inside the code that could be very tricky to find.
