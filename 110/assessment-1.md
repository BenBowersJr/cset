HTML being a open standard instead of being owed by a certain company helps anyone decide they want to make a website. It helps greatly in making the internet available for everyone, and everyone can access it without needing a specific browser or application, all browsers are accepted and websites are generally made to work with future and past technologies. 


In HTML its common to see something that looks like this ```<p>This is a test HTML element</p>``` In that example, ```<p>``` and ```</p>``` are the tags that define what the HTML should do with the contents. everything between the tags is the HTML element. most tags needs a closing tag at the end defined with a / in the <> signs, but some tags like the ```<img>``` tag do not need a closing tag and close automatically.


The quote you used from yoda is "The greatest teacher, failure is." and is this an example of a syntax error. Yoda speaks incorrectly, and he does not follow the rules of the english language. The second quote is from Noam Chomsky, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." This is an example of being semantically incorrect, while it follows the rules of the english language. it does to convey the meaning correctly and does not make sense. We have tools to find syntax errors, but semantic errors can only be found by the user/humans.
