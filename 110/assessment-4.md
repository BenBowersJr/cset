1:  the non-standard aspects tell us that other platforms and user interfaces can be completely different and our pages might look different on other platforms. We are going to have to worry about making our pages responsive for those user interfaces.

2: Media queries are really helpful features we can use to make our pages much more responsive with queries like ```@media only screen and (min-width: 751px)```. this always checks the page to see if the screen has a min-width of 751pixels. Any styles inside of the media query will be active as long as the media query is true like a if statement in javascript. We could also use media queries to change how the page looks when the user tries to print the screen, we can change the print screen with ```@media print``` and applying styles accordingly

3: Its better to define breakpoints by the content on the site because this will make it responsive and change accordingly to the screen size of the user, no matter what size the screen is. If we used standard screen sizes, we may need to create new breakpoints when a new screen size has been made standard. Instead of our page will automatically change according to what screensize and aspect ratio the user is using.
